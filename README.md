# njrsync
rsync backup script to backup all you want in your system and zip it in your home directory.

njrsync.list is a sample list ( from my raspberry pi2)

Edit the 'njrsync.list' file to select folders or files to backup ; and edit folders sources & destinations variables in the bash script as your convenience.
